1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm Mike Donahue.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, don't worry.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I won't be needing this 
where we're going.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Freeze! 
Special Agent DeMarco. Put your fucking hands up.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This guy just hired me 
at a firm called Firefense.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Go ahead, grab one Mike.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What's the occasion Oliver?

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A toast to Mike,

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm really looking forward to tomorrow.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is some colleague from work
I still don't know much about.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So Mike, what's so special 
about your preemptive rootkit?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, administrators are usually bound
to monitoring local traffic

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and event logging can be faked
if the router is already compromised,

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Like the attempt on Syria.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In a warzone it's frequent to shut down
Internet and mobile phone access

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
to opposition held areas.

17
00:01:33:42,000 --> 00:01:38,000
BGP routes to Syria's IP space

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
were all simultaneously withdrawn
from all of Syria's upstream providers.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Al-Assad blamed the outage 
on a terrorist attack.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,00
Only it wasn't.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That can only be done at
the backbone router level

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and only big agencies like the NSA, 
or crazy lonewolf hackers, would attempt so.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And you can?

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I do.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And I wouldn't have bricked it.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Ok gentlemen, this one's on me!

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Or I should say, Firefense.
Cheers

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
[Doorbell]

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,00
Hi Mrs. Sievers!

30 
00:02:16,00 --> 00:02:17:00
- Hi Mike. 
- Right, right now's not a good time.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
- It's Mrs. Sievers.
- Well, it's never a good time with you.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,00
- Can you put her on the phone, please?
- I heard you were working all night

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So I though I'd just bring you
a little something.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,00
I'm not hungry

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No way! You'll talk about me.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Ok, you know what?
Just tell her I said hi.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
- Will do!
- And good luck tomorrow.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There's a mosquito in my room.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm hungry now!

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't you just hate it when you
hear that thing buzzing around

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
but you don't know where
it's coming from?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We open the door, close it behind us
and wait for the prey.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Thanks Mike!

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Awesome job.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Basically ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
we're the only ones in the world
that can monitor from inside the router.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't think we're the only ones, though.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Intelligent agencies have access to all
sorts of backdoors and vulnerabilities.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And not just of routers, of TVs and cellphones.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Think about all the data that 
those devices collect.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Good.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Any questions?

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, you're saying the government, 
therefore public resources,

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
are being used to hack into 
American companies to spy on people?

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's right.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
[Oliver] Well, I certainy hope so. I mean, 
that's how we catch the terorists, right?

57
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
[Oliver] Ja, ja, ja

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Ok, we're going to be debriefing after lunch

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I wanna see everybody back here at 2 oÂ´clock.
Lady and gentlemen. 

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Sharp!

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let me talk with you for a second. 
I need you to go over this report.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, how did it go?

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Good.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Uhm, that's beeping.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's wrong?

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It looks like

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
someone is trying to hack into Firefense.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is that even possible?

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Someone is trying to patch the router hypervisor
through the main network parser process.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mia, listen. They were using the 
same fucking vulnerabilities

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
as the attack on Syria.

72
00:04:31,00 --> 00:04:32,000
But, what for?

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Data.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Firefense is used on most
of the biggest Internet sites

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
When they receive more traffic
that they can handle

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
they turn it on so we manage 
the traffic volume for them

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So, by hacking into Firefense you can
perform direct traffic interception?

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Including HTTPS connections.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So wait, you think the NSA is trying
to get into Firefense?

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It could be them or some other skilled group.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How serious is this?

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We don't know yet, General.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Not pretty.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Mike Donahue is onto us, Sir.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Who's that?

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I was guaranteed stealthiness 
for this operation.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, Donahue is an analyst at Firefense,

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and it's very possible he may be 
close to subverting the operation.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We acquired access to various third party
infrastructures across the world

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and use them as proxy chain and cover.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Operation management on the last hop
is performed from a local business.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Right now, the group is completely
oblivious to it.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So what is our exposure at this time?

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And can we be linked to them?

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We are reevaluating our OPSEC 
in the operation now.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We don't know.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll trace the packets back.

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Mike, I don't think you should do this.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why shouldn't I?

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If Firefense is under attack, 
so is Facebook, Yahoo, Google...

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is not some kid's playground, you know?

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
More of the reason to expose it.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I mean, the people deserve to know

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't, don't you understand?

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No, I do!

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's just that if the NSA is behind all that

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you're going to have the FBI on your back in no time.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Why would you want to take on that risk?

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Samuel didn't die for a country of leechers.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh I see. It's your own
personal ghosts again.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Fuck you.
Stop saying that.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Mike, it's been 2 years for fucks sake.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Please, just don't do anything-

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
stupid.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Fuck.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hey...

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Hey!

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What was that about?

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Turns out, George Orwell was an optimist.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I think he might be onto something this time.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Ok, fill me in.

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
PRISM is a code name for a data 
collection effort born in 2007.

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Here's something you need to know.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Government programs like PRISM

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
are not really about doing surveillance on
people they think are doing something wrong.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's about doing surveillance
on everybody.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Intelligence agencies did not invent
bulk Internet surveillance,

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It was invented by private companies.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Intelligence agencies just realized that they
could use the data collected by those companies

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Because the Internet is massively complex

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
your domestic communication between 
you and your wife

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
can go from New York to London and back 
and get caught up in the middle.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Most people couldn't care less 
about online surveillance 

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
because they think they have
nothing to hide.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You might have nothing to hide,
but you have everything to protect.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Initially network traffic came from China

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
but, hey, I wasn't going to 
be pulling a Mandiant.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It didn't take too long to find 
this unserialization vulnerability

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
to get code execution in 
the Chinese server.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The Chinese server then connected
to a printer in the UK.

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Classy!

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I know what to do now.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's good to have Sonic friends,

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
you nudge them, and zero days come off.

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Please, please, please.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well that was convenient.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The next hop in the communication was the server in Russia.

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Many servers running...
I could feel the rush.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The shellshock thing.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Focus!

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Luckily, I had extra help now.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm on it.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Including Mia.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Got it! 

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Shellshock on the header values on 8080

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I used private kernel exploit to escalate
privileges to root on the Russian server.

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That IP prefix...

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
US?

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Are you kidding me?
A bakeshop!

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is this a Hollywood movie or what?

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Time for a physical visit?

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Definitely!

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,500
Hello. My name is Mike Donahue.

165
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,000
I live down the street. 
Oh, hi Mrs. Sievers.

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hi Mike!

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I work for a cybersecurity 
company named Firefense

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and our servers have been compromised

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
by a rootkit, that connected to our... and...

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
...I need you help!

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
My help?

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes.

173
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We've tracked the C&C and it jumped to
a VPS in China, the UK, then Russia

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and finally back here.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Here?

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's right. I believe you're the proxy. 
That is the proxy.

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't understand son.

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The C&C is...

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I just need a few minutes.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
A few moments?

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes, to set up the tools and track 
back the proxy traffic.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Scoot! No way you're touching that.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I just spent $500 to get it fixed
and you're not going near it.

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But ma'am, you don't understand. 
You're being hacked.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh no. 
I won't bite.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I know what this is.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I read all those chain emails.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You just wanna get to my Facebook photos
and hand them in to Obama.

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You have no right to expose me, son.

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Mike, don't expose the woman.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I know what them hackers do

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
they spy on your photos 
and they read all your texts

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They can even steal money from you bank account
and send it to Switzerland or something.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Really?

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh, it's terrible.

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I know.

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, wait.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Did you include my cream pie?

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well you know that's why I don't use banks.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I keep my money at home under my mattress

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's what my mother told me to do.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Thank you, bye!

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
They are deciding my future.

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Precisely those who want my head,

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
who want my knowledge.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
They want me to stay quiet because 
I know what they have always tried to hide.

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm John Inglis, deputy director of the
National Security Agency. 

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How are you?

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I'm only one person.

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I know about your trip to Bermuda.
About your fling with your cousin.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I know what you think about your boss

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and I've seen your dick pic too.

213
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You were speeding during your DUI

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You googled for Chihuahua puppies
and how to poison your mother in law.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Your phone was listening in your pocket

216
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,500
when you met Lucy for the first time,
when you made love with her too.

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But I didn't steal it.

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It has travelled miles around the world
and is let back into the country.

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Homeland security? Domestic?

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,500
Bullshit.

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We need to know who are you working with.

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Your little stunt is putting American citizens' lives 
in danger and I cannot let that happen.

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's a lie.

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
There are no frontiers to data,

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and the Patriot Act was never 
designed to protect you

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We have this information now, and we no longer 
get the luxury of pleading ignorance.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Guilty.
